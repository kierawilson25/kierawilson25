            <p>One cool thing about me is that I have a big family. I have four sisters (I know...my poor dad) </br>
                 who are my best friends. My parents and my two older sisters were born in Canda, but my two </br>
                 younger sisters and I were both in the States. So we are all duel citizens of Canada and America! </p>

            <p>I serve in the National Guard part time which means I get to do a lof of fun things that I would
            not have experinced other wise. This summer some of the cool things I did included: driving a HUMVEE
            riding along inambulences, and I even got to ride in the Blackhawk pictured. </p>

            <p> One of my younger sisters is going to school in Ely, Minnesota for outdoor leadership. </br>
            This summer she worked at a canoe outfiter which meant me and my family got to visit and put  </br>
            out paddling skills to the test. My family loves <br>the boundary waters and we try to make it up 
            there to camp atleast once a year.</br> </p>
