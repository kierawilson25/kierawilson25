### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kiera Wilson 

I am a creative problem solver at heart,

and a Software Engineer by day.


This space is a collection of projects I have worked on starting with undergrad. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and I am currently pursing my Masters in Software Engineering at my alma matter, University of St. Thomas. 

Click around to see what I've been working on lately.
