### ✨ Welcome 👋 ✨

My name is Kiera Wilson.

I am a creative problem solver at heart,

and a Software Engineer by day.


This space is a collection of projects I have worked on starting with undergrad. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and I am currently pursing my Masters in Software Engineering at my alma matter, University of St. Thomas. 

I am a Claude Code power user and love building new websites. 

🔭 I’m currently working on
  - GrainsofSand.app - a habit tracker meant to help people make small changes over time
  - SuperSecretSupper.com - a dinner pairing site for friend groups to use to build stronger individual relationships
